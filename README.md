# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## In this project, I applied the concepts learned in machine learning to develop a predictive model. I gained experience in:

- **Data cleaning and preprocessing:** Handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, and converting categorical features to numerical values.
- **Feature engineering:** Applying one-hot encoding and removing highly correlated features.
- **Normalization:** Scaling data to ensure features are on a similar scale.
- **Building a logistic regression model from scratch:** Implementing key functions like sigmoid, cost computation, and gradient descent.
- **Model evaluation and visualization:** Assessing model performance and visualizing the decision boundary.
- **Making predictions:** Creating a function to predict customer churn based on input data.

## Customer Churn Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project involves building a logistic regression model to predict whether a customer will churn based on various features provided in the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to create a logistic regression model to predict customer churn. The project includes steps for data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and making predictions.

## Features

- **Customer Information:** Various features related to customer demographics and services, including gender, partner status, and contract type.
- **Service Usage:** Features related to the services used by the customer, such as phone service, online backup, and streaming options.
